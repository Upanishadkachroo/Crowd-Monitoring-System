# Smart Crowd Monitoring and Choke Point Prevention System

---

## Project Overview

This project started with a simple goal: **detect the number of people in a store and alert if the number exceeds a threshold**.

Through brainstorming and discussion, we evolved it into a **substantial, real-world system** that can:

1. Monitor crowd density in real time  
2. Predict the possibility of stampedes  
3. Identify and prevent choke points  
4. Provide actionable, visual outputs for authorities  

The final system is called the **Smart Crowd Monitoring and Choke Point Prevention System**, designed to enhance public safety through **video analysis, intelligent clustering, graph-theoretic insights, and dynamic visualizations**.

## Key Features

* **YOLOv8n People Detection** – Real-time people detection using a pre-trained YOLOv8n model.  
* **Surge Prediction** – Uses **Weighted Moving Average (WMA)** to predict upcoming surges in crowd density.  
* **Fuzzy Risk Classification** – Employs **fuzzy set theory** to dynamically classify risk levels without hardcoded thresholds.  
* **Graph-based Choke Point Detection** –  
  * Uses **graph isomorphism** to compare crowd layouts to known risky patterns.  
  * Detects **articulation points** to identify critical individuals or clusters that could cause bottlenecks.  
* **Anomaly Detection** – Applies **z-score analysis** to flag unusual crowd behaviors or density spikes.  
* **Safer Zone Visualization** –  
  * Uses **DBSCAN clustering** and overlays it onto **Voronoi diagrams** to highlight safer, lower-density areas.
